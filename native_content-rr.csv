1234,5678,JohnnieB,This product is amazing!!!,"Hands down, my favorite, on-the-go, healthy snack is a LARABAR. When I opened my box to find the chocolate chip cookie dough bar I shrieked! Literally.  It was pretty good.  I don't eat many bars like that, so it was nice to be able to try it before buying it.",4,9/24/12,11:35,25,"Los Angeles, CA"
1221,5665,Jimmy2Tone,I'm love with this,"I love food samples especially if they are all natural or organic. I am currently switching my food intake to all natural and organic. This is a nice way to get a nice snack/chocolate in without  having to stray from goals. Thank you, I  really liked it!",5,9/12/12,16:44,35,
1345,5789,Nema2,It was alright.,"This is the first edible ""extra"" that I didn't like. The taste wasn't very good (I had the coconut cream pie one- sounded promising) and the texture was repulsive. At least I know never to purchase one of these bars in the future! :)",3,9/18/12,22:12,,"Austin, TX"
